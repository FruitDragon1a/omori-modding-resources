# Omori Modding Resources

Welcome to the mods.one OMORI modding resources repository. The purpose of this repository is to be a single place for as many useful resources for modding OMORI as possible.

## Structure:

Each resource lives in a directory denoting it's category, then a directory for itself, together with a short readme.
